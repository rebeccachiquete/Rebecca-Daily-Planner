HTML was super easy, we went over creating it in class. Just had to create one line and then copy and change the hours. 

I had a tough time i put the JS file above the jquery and it was giving me an error. Finally figured that out.

functions are getting easier with time. This was was a little tricky because I forgot about the JSON.parse but a classmate reminded me and that made it click in my mind. 

my page was not saving the "Tasks" and it was frustracting me. Then I realized on line 66 in JS i had it written without a capital and when i fixed that it worked. 

Tutor went over arrays and Jquery with me on wednesday so that realllllly helped. 

It was nice having CSS already created.
