HTML was super easy, we went over creating it in class. Just had to create one line and then copy and change the hours. 

I had a tough time i put the JS file above the jquery and it was giving me an error. Finally figured that out.

functions are getting easier with time. This was was a little tricky because I forgot about the JSON.parse but a classmate reminded me and that made it click in my mind. 

my page was not saving the "Tasks" and it was frustracting me. Then I realized on line 66 in JS i had it written without a capital and when i fixed that it worked. 

Tutor went over arrays and Jquery with me on wednesday so that realllllly helped. 

It was nice having CSS already created. 

Cant figure out what I did wrong or didnt do for the colors to not be correct with the time. I think maybe i used the wrong code for moment. I used var dayHours = moment().format('LT'); on line 11 in JS. To be honest I think that we could have had more info on moment and how to use it. I had to youtube and im just not sure if I did that right. 

spoke with TA - changed from 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 to 9,10,11,12,1,2,3,4,5 - at current moment cant figure out how to get present to show. 

after that did not show future - changed to 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 and that showed it. TA Nellie suggested that.
